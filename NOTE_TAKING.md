# Note taking

## Feynman technique
 - 1. Identify the subject
     - Write down everything you know about the topic
     - Add notes for each new source/piece of information
 - 2. Teach it to yourself:
     - "Teach it to a child"
     - Write down, in as simple terms as possible, a description and explanation of the topic.
     - The goals: plainness, brevity
 - 3. Identify your knowledge gaps - Reflect, Refine, and Simplify
     - Spend time on this one to ensure you fill in these gaps.
     - Add questions and things that are confusing here, then research and fill in the missing gaps
       with the things found and learned.
 - 4. Organize + Review + Tell a story
     - Streamline notes
     - Create analogies
     - Maybe try to piece together notes "to spin a tale" using concise explanations
     - Bring the most vital pieces of knowledge about the topic

There could be a cycle between 2 and 3 while filling in gaps and creating explanations
